# Synopsis
>Want to protect your privacy from prying eyes? Need custom DNS management? Pi-Hole is a light-weight docker container that can help you protect your online presence.
{: .prompt-info }

The Pi-Hole project was originally designed with the RaspberryPi in mind as a light-weight Ad Blocker and DHCP server. As a docker container, you can run Pi-Hole on any Linux distribution that can support docker. While not required, I also recommend that you run two instances of Pi-Hole. If one is offline, you will lose internet access. I will go through setting up configuration sync as part of this Hack. If you are looking for a project to explore using a [RaspberryPi](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Rpi/), this is a great starter project for you. I will present both a docker compose and Portainer install methods.

## Pre-requisites
For this Hack, I am making a few assumptions. If you need to meet any of the requirement, refer to some of my other Hacks to help you fullfil them.
- You have a [RaspberryPi](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Rpi/) or other Linux server to install Pi-Hole on.
- You have installed and tested [Docker](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Docker_Ubuntu/).
- For Portainer install you should have a working instance of [Portainer](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io) configured.

## Installing Pi-Hole Using Docker Compose
- Connect to your RaspberryPi/Linux Server that you have prepared for install.
- Create a directory to house your persisted configuration and create an empty docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker_services/pi-hole/etc-pihole
cd ~/docker_services/pi-hole
touch docker-compose.yml
```

- Copy/Paste the following YAML into the new docker-compose.yml file, replacing the required fields with your config settings:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      # DNS Ports
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      # Default HTTP Port, if you are running other web based services on your docker host you may need to change the exposed port
      - "80:80/tcp"
      # Default HTTPs Port. FTL will generate a self-signed certificate. If you are running other web based services on your docker host you may need to change the exposed port
      - "443:443/tcp"
      # Uncomment the line below if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server
      #- "67:67/udp"
      # Uncomment the line below if you are using Pi-hole as your NTP server
      #- "123:123/udp"
    environment:
      # Set the appropriate timezone for your location (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), e.g:
      TZ: 'America/Denver'
      # Set a password to access the web interface. Not setting one will result in a random password being assigned
      FTLCONF_webserver_api_password: 'yoursupersecretpassword'
      # If using Docker's default `bridge` network setting the dns listening mode should be set to 'all'
      FTLCONF_dns_listeningMode: 'all'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      # For persisting Pi-hole's databases and common configuration file
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      # Uncomment the below if you have custom dnsmasq config files that you want to persist. Not needed for most starting fresh with Pi-hole v6. If you're upgrading from v5 you and have used this directory before, you should keep it enabled for the first v6 container start to allow for a complete migration. It can be removed afterwards. Needs environment variable FTLCONF_misc_etc_dnsmasq_d: 'true'
      #- './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    cap_add:
      # See https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
      # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server, else not needed
      - NET_ADMIN
      # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your NTP client to be able to set the host's system time
      - SYS_TIME
      # Optional, if Pi-hole should get some more processing time
      - SYS_NICE
    restart: unless-stopped
```

- If you are using Ubuntu as your OS, you will need to disable the DNS-stub resolver as it is using port 53 on the host:

```bash
sudo sed -r -i.orig 's/#?DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/g' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo sh -c 'rm /etc/resolv.conf && ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf'
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

- Build the docker container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Verify the docker container is started and listed as **Healthy**:

```bash
docker ps
```

- You should be able to access Pi-Hole at https://IPADDRESS/admin of your server.
- Log into Pi-Hole to verify you password was set correctly and you can access the Dashboard.
- Continue with Setting up DHCP to use Pi-Hole.

## Installing Pi-Hole with Portainer
You can use this guide to install Pi-Hole on your WSL Docker install or on a remote Docker server as long as you have installed the [Portainer Agent](https://hydrahacksdoc.github.io/posts/Portainer/) on the remote server.
- If you are using Ubuntu as your OS, you will need to disable the DNS-stub resolver as it is using port 53 on the host:

```bash
sudo sed -r -i.orig 's/#?DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/g' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo sh -c 'rm /etc/resolv.conf && ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf'
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

- Log into your Portainer Instance.
- Select your remote or local Docker server.

![Menu](/2025-05-28/docker.png){: width="300" }
_Docker Server_

- From the left-hand menu select **Stacks**.

![Stacks](/2025-05-28/stacks.png){: width="300" }
_Select Stacks_

- Click on **"+ Add Stack"** from top-right of create stacks panel.

_Web Editor_

- Paste the following YAML into the editor adjusting for your preferences. If your already have something hosted on port 80 and 4443 you may need to adjust them:

```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
      - "443:443/tcp"
    env_file:
     - stack.env
    volumes:
      - 'etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
    restart: always
volumes:
  etc-pihole:
    driver: local
```
- Click on **Advanced Mode** under environmental variables and paste the following YAML adjusting for your preferences:

```yaml
TZ=America/Denver
FTLCONF_webserver_api_password='yoursupersecretpassword'
FTLCONF_dns_listeningMode='all'
```

- Select **Administrators** under access control.

![ACL](/2025-05-28/acl.png){: width="300" }
_Access Control_

- Click on **Deploy Stack**.

![Deploy](/2025-05-28/deploy.png){: width="150" }
_Deploy Stack_

- Wait for the stack to finish deploying then you should be able to access Pi-Hole at https://IPADDRESS/admin of your server.
- Log into Pi-Hole to verify you password was set correctly and you can access the Dashboard.
- Continue with Setting up DHCP to use Pi-Hole.

## Setup DHCP/Static DNS
Once you have your Pi-Hole configured you need to update your computers to use them to block ads. Every network is different, so this is where you will need to understand your own network. Update your network router or DNS server to use the new IP address of the Pi-Hole instance. Again as stated earlier I would recommend using more than one Pi-Hole instance do you don't lose internet access while it's down. If you are not sure how to adjust your router's DNS you can change the static DNS setting on your Windows Network as well, but keep in mind that Pi-Hole will only be active to that one machine you changed the settings on.

## Syncing Changes Between Multiple Pi-Hole Instances
Since I have harped on you about needing more than one Pi-Hole, let's look at an automated way to keep them in sync. On version 6.x or later it is recommended that you use Nebula-Sync to handle the sync duties of your Pi-Hole instances. This runs as a docker container and can run anywhere you have docker installed. For purposes of this Hack, I am going to assume you want to run the service the same place you are running your primary Pi-Hole instance.

- We are going to be updating the docker-compose.yml file or Portainer config depending on your installed method. I'll give examples of how to update each one.

### Docker Compose Method
- You will need to set an API Password in your Pi-Hole Instance for use in the config below.
- Log into your primary Pi-Hole instance, then from the left-hand menu select **System -> Settings -> Web Interface/API**.
- Click the **Basic** button on the top-right of the Setting panel to show as **Expert**.
- In the **Advanced** Panel, select the **Configure app password** button. This will display a new auto-generated password for you. Copy this password and save for later.
- Click on Enable App Password. It will force you to log out.
- Log back into your Pi-Hole instance.
- From the left-hand menu, select **System -> Settings -> All Settings**.
- Click on the **Webserver and API** Tab.
- Scroll down until you find the panel labeled **webserver.api.app_sudo**, click on Enabled.
- Repeat this process for each Pi-Hole instance.
- Open up the docker-compose file that you used to create your primary Pi-Hole instance. If you used this guide, see the docker-compose.yml example from above.

```bash
cd ~/docker_services/pi-hole
nano docker-compose.yml
```

- Add the following to the end of your YAML file under the **services:** section:

```yaml
---
  nebula-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/lovelaze/nebula-sync:latest
    container_name: nebula-sync
    depends_on:
      pihole:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true
    env_file: .env
```

- Now let's create the .env file and set some environmental variables:

```bash
nano .env
```

- To have full automatic sync, paste in the following YAML config changing the settings to match your installation. If you choose, you can adjust the sync parameters using the [Nebula Guide](https://github.com/lovelaze/nebula-sync):

```yaml
PRIMARY="https://PRIMARYIPADDRESS|yoursupersecretpassword"
REPLICAS="https://SECONDARYIPADDRESS|yoursupersecretpassword
FULL_SYNC=true
RUN_GRAVITY=true
CRON=0 * * * *
TZ=America/Denver
CLIENT_SKIP_TLS_VERIFICATION=true
```

- Now deploy the docker container using docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Wait for the deployment to finish then check the status of the container to make sure it is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

- You are all set for Nebula-sync to keep your Pi-Hole in sync.

### Portainer Method
- You will need to set an API Password in your Pi-Hole Instance for use in the config below.
- Log into your primary Pi-Hole instance, then from the left-hand menu select **System -> Settings -> Web Interface/API**.
- Click the **Basic** button on the top-right of the Setting panel to show as **Expert**.
- In the **Advanced** Panel, select the **Configure app password** button. This will display a new auto-generated password for you. Copy this password and save for later.
- Click on Enable App Password. It will force you to log out.
- Log back into your Pi-Hole instance.
- From the left-hand menu, select **System -> Settings -> All Settings**.
- Click on the **Webserver and API** Tab.
- Scroll down until you find the panel labeled **webserver.api.app_sudo**, click on Enabled.
- Repeat this process for each Pi-Hole instance.
- Log into your Portainer instance and select the stack that is running your Pi-Hole instance.
- Switch to the **Editor** tab so you can adjust the deployment.
- At the end of the configuration for Pi-Hole add the following YAML configuration for Nebula:

```yaml
  nebula-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/lovelaze/nebula-sync:latest
    container_name: nebula-sync
    depends_on:
      pihole:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true
    env_file:
     - stack.env
```

- Open the **Advanced Mode** under Environmental Variables and add the following adjusting for your settings. If you choose, you can adjust the sync parameters using the [Nebula Guide](https://github.com/lovelaze/nebula-sync):

```yaml
PRIMARY="https://PRIMARYIPADDRESS|yoursupersecretpassword"
REPLICAS="https://SECONDARYIPADDRESS|yoursupersecretpassword
FULL_SYNC=true
RUN_GRAVITY=true
CRON=0 * * * *
TZ=America/Denver
CLIENT_SKIP_TLS_VERIFICATION=true
```

- Click on **Update Stack** to re-deploy the Pi-Hole and Nebula-Sync containers.
- You are all set for Nebula-sync to keep your Pi-Hole in sync.
