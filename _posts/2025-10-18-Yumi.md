# Synopsis
>YUMI is a software tool that will help you create a bootable USB drive that supports multiple OS images.
{: .prompt-info }

This Hack is going to show you how to create your very own multiple OS USB boot drive. I recommend that you use an NVMe based usb-c or usb3 drive although you can use a standard usb3 drive. I like this drive from SSK, and it's available from Amazon, [SSK NVMe USB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJV2KBFV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).

## Download the YUMI USB Image Tool
- You can download the YUMI-exfat USB Image Tool directly from [YUMI](https://yumiusb.com/yumi-exfat/). The YUMI-exfat version is the latest and only currently supported version.
- The tool is available to both Windows and Linux. Both are standalone executable images, so no need to install anything.

## Create a Bootable USB Drive
- Insert the USB drive that you want to use to install YUMI-exfat onto.
- Launch the YUMI-exfat image that you downloaded earlier.
- Agree to the License Agreement.

- Step 1: Choose the USB Drive.
- Step 2: Select your Distribution (i.e. Proxmox).
- Step 3: Browse to the ISO image that you downloaded for the distro. If you have not downloaded the ISO yet YUMI gives you the option to download directly from the installer which is a nice feature.
- Now click on **Create** to create the YUMI Bootable USB Drive.

- Wait for it to copy the ISO and YUMI to the USB drive. Once complete it will ask if you would like to install more distros or exit.

`As a side note, if you select a Linux distro that supports persistence, YUMI will ask you if you want to create the persistence file during creation. This is useful if you plan to run a distro from the USB drive and want it to retain any changes you make to the running distro.`
