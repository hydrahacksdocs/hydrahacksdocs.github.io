# Synopsis
>Homepage is a nice web-based docker container image used the help you keep track of your home lab service status, their URLs, basic service information and look good doing it.
{: .prompt-info }

Homepage is traditionally installed through docker compose, as it makes keeping all your config and site settings together. However, since you may have followed my [Portainer](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Portainer/) Hack, I will give you a way to install it through Portainer as well. Both of these instructions will work with either a stand-a-lone docker install or Docker Desktop on Windows with WSL. As part of this install we are also going to include the docker-socket-proxy container to provide a more secure way to talk to the docker engine.

## Docker Compose Install
1. Open Windows Terminal WSL or SSH into your Linux docker server.
2. I prefer to keep all my docker services that I deploy through docker compose together in my home directory, but this is a personal choice. You may want to use a more universal directory like /data/docker_services. Let's create a directory to hold all our docker compose services & create the directory for homepage:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p docker_services/homepage
cd docker_services/homepage
```

3. Homepage uses local config files to change the layout and configuration of widgets. You will need to pre-create at least the config directory. For access to some local images and icons though, we need to create two other directories as well:

```bash
mkdir -p config
mkdir -p images
mkdir -p icons
```

4. Create an empty docker-compose.yml file for your docker container configuration:

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

5. Edit the docker-compose.yml file with nano or VS Code (WSL) and copy the following YAML into it:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```bash
code docker-compose.yml
```

```yaml
services:
  dockerproxy:
  image: ghcr.io/tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest
  container_name: dockerproxy
  environment:
    - CONTAINERS=1
    - SERVICES=1
    - TASKS=1
    - POST=0
  ports:
    - 2375:2375
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
  restart: always

homepage:
  image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
  container_name: homepage
  volumes:
    - ./config:/app/config
    - ./images:/app/public/images
    - ./icons:/app/public/icons
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
  restart: always

  environment:
    - PUID: $PUID
    - PGID: $PGID
    - HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: localhost
```

6. Create a docker compose .env file to hold some secrets and variables that Homepage needs:

```bash
touch .env
```

7. You will need to tell Homepage what your local Linux username and group IDs are. You can get your UID/GID by running this command:

```bash
id
```

8. Edit the .env file with nano or VS Code (WSL) and enter some variables for our basic config:

```bash
nano .env
```

```bash
code .env
```

```yaml
# Since docker should be running under our local Linux username, let's make sure Homepage knows what our account ID is.
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
```

9. Deploy the Homepage/Docker-socket-proxy containers with docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

10. Once you are returned to the command prompt, check the status of the containers. Repeat until both containers are up or healthy:

```bash
docker ps
```

11. Move to the **Basic Config & Tips** section to continue setting up Homepage.

## Portainer Install
1. Open Windows Terminal WSL or SSH into your Linux docker server.
2. I prefer to keep all my docker services that I deploy together in my home directory, but this is a personal choice. You may want to use a more universal directory like /data/docker_services. Let's create a directory to hold all our docker services & create the directory for homepage:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p docker_services/homepage
cd docker_services/homepage
```

3. Homepage uses local config files to change the layout and configuration of widgets. You will need to pre-create at least the config directory. For access to some local images and icons though, we need to create two other directories as well:

```bash
mkdir -p config
mkdir -p images
mkdir -p icons
```

4. You will need to tell Homepage what your local Linux username and group IDs are. You can get your UID/GID by running this command:

```bash
id
```

5. Log into your [Portainer](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Portainer/) instance and select the **local** docker environment:

    ![local docker](/2025-05-22/local_docker.png){: width="300" }
    _local docker_

6. Select **Stacks** from the left-hand menu:

    ![Stacks](/2025-05-22/stacks_menu.png){: width="300" }
    _Stacks Menu_

7. Click on **+ Add Stack** button at the top-right of the stacks dashboard:

    ![Add Stack](/2025-05-22/add_stack.png){: width="150" }
    _Add Stack_

8. Enter a name for the stack, like homepage.
9. For Build Method select the **Web Editor** as built type.

    ![Web Editor](/2025-05-22/web_edit.png){: width="300" }
    _Web Editor_

10. In the Web Editor field enter the following YAML config replacing the volumes location with the location you used above:

```yaml
services:
  dockerproxy:
    image: ghcr.io/tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest
    container_name: dockerproxy
    ports:
      - 2375:2375
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    restart: always
    env_file:
     - stack.env
  
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    volumes:
      - ~/docker_services/homepage/config:/app/config
      - ~/docker_services/homepage/icons:/app/public/icons
      - ~/docker_services/homepage/images:/app/public/images
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    restart: always
    env_file:
     - stack.env
```

11. Under the Environmental Variables click on the **Advanced Mode** and then enter the following variables, updating the PUID/PGID with your user IDs:

    ![Env Variables](/2025-05-22/env.png){: width="300" }
    _Env Variables_

```yaml
CONTAINERS=1
SERVICES=1
TASKS=1
POST=0
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
```

12. Under the Access Control Section select **Administrator**.

    ![Access](/2025-05-22/access_control.png){: width="300" }
    _Access Control_

13. Click on **Deploy Stack**.
14. Once deployed you will be able to watch the status of the containers under the **Containers** menu item from the left. Once both dockerproxy and homepage are running or healthy you can move on to the Basic Config & Tips Section.

## Basic Config & Tips
>If everything from the previous steps completed correctly you will be able to see the default Homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
{: prompt-info}

1. There are a lot of things you can customize with [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/configs/). Read through the docs to play with some of the settings. Let's set some basic stuff though so you can see some of the widgets in action.
2. Enable Docker Status Widgets. Homepage will let us display some basic information about our running docker containers, so let's configure the homepage and dockerproxy containers, and if you have portainer installed as well, I'll include it.
3. Everything is managed and configured through YAML files back on our WSL or docker server we deployed Homepage through. Open your Windows Terminal WSL or remote into your docker server and go to the directory we configure for homepage:

```bash
cd ~/docker_services/homepage
```

4. Open the nano or VS Code (WSL) editor to edit the following file:

```bash
nano config/docker.yaml
```

```bash
code config/docker.yaml
```

5. Paste the following yaml config in order to use your new dockerproxy service and save the file:

```yaml
wsl-docker:
   host: dockerproxy
   port: 2375
```

6. Next let's update some of the basic setting with some customizations. Again, there are lots of options here, like background images, layout, and tab configuration, so use the Homepage docs to learn more. Open the settings.yaml file:

```bash
nano config/settings.yaml
```

```bash
code config/settings.yaml
```

7. Edit or add the following lines of YAML:

```yaml
title: Home Lab Services
description: Collection of Services Hosted in my Home Lab
theme: dark
color: slate
headerStyle: boxed
showStats: true
useEqualHeights: true
```

8. Your new changes should auto-refresh and you can see the updates you made in realtime.
9. Now let's get rid of the default services and add our own for the docker containers. For this though we are going to need to add some environmental variables to our Homepage stack back in Portainer. So log back in to your Portainer instance and navigate back to Stacks and select our homepage stack from earlier.
10. Select the Editor Tab at the top under Stack details and then scroll down to the Environment section, expand it and click on advanced once again. Paste in the following new variables:

    ![Editor](/2025-05-22/stack_editor.png){: width="150" }
    _Editor_


```yaml
HOMEPAGE_VAR_HOMEPAGE_URL=http://localhost:3000
HOMEPAGE_VAR_PORTAINER_URL=https://localhost:9443
```

11. Click on **Update Stack**, this will force a rebuild of our stack and add the new variables. You will repeat this process for any other variables that you want to add for any new services that you add. Once the containers are once again healthy or running you can move to the next step.
12. Back in your Linux terminal, open the services.yaml file and replace the config with the following config then save the file:

```bash
nano config/services.yaml
```

```bash
code config/services.yaml
```

```yaml
- Docker:
    - Portainer:
        icon: si-portainer
        href: "{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_PORTAINER_URL}}"
        description: wsl-docker
        server: wsl-docker
        container: portainer
    - Homepage:
        icon: si-homepage
        href: "{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_HOMEPAGE_URL}}"
        description: wsl-docker
        server: wsl-docker
        container: homepage
    - DockerProxy:
        icon: si-nginxproxymanager
        href: "{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_HOMEPAGE_URL}}"
        description: wsl-docker
        server: wsl-docker
        container: dockerproxy
```

13. Back on your Homepage web site, you should see it auto-update with the Docker Group and the three containers that we added to the services YAML file, with a bit of information about each container being displayed.
14. Finally, let's update the Bookmarks at the bottom of the Homepage site.
15. Open the bookmarks.yaml config file with nano or VS Code (WSL):

```bash
nano config/bookmarks.yaml
```

```bash
code config/bookmarks.yaml
```

16. This is an example of what you can put in your bookmarks config, so update it as you prefer. Again, refer to the Homepage Docs for added help:

```yaml
- Developer:
    - Github:
        - abbr: GH
          icon: si-github
          description: My Repos on Github
          href: https://<yourusername>.github.com/

- Social:
    - Reddit:
        - abbr: RE
          icon: si-reddit
          description: The frontpage of the internet
          href: https://reddit.com/

- Entertainment:
    - YouTube:
        - abbr: YT
          icon: si-youtube
          description: Youtube
          href: https://youtube.com/

- Service Homepages:
    - Homepage Configs Website:
        - abbr: HP
          icon: si-homepage
          description: Homepage Config Docs
          href: https://gethomepage.dev/
```

17. Your Homepage site will once again auto-refresh with the new bookmarks at the bottom of the page.

>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional Homepage that you can use and customize. Take some time to look at the [HOmepage Config Docs](https://gethomepage.dev/) to add more customization to Homepage. Try creating a background image, creating tabs, and adding more bookmarks!
