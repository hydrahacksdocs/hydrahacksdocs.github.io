# Synopsis
>Most services that we run in our home lab run in Linux. If you don't have dedicated hardware yet, we can start to learn Linux by using WSL. Let's get it installed and configured.
{: .prompt-info }

Windows System for Linux (WSL) was created by Microsoft as a way you can run Linux commands inside of your Windows installation. It is useful for testing out new applications, remote Linux server management, even testing out different Linux distributions. Some functionality is limited in the WSL environment as Microsoft needs to make sure that it stays within their expected configuration, so as soon as you have some dedicated hardware it is advisable to switch.

We are going to focus on basic setup and configuration in this Hack with further customization available through other Linux Hacks.

## WSL Installation and Configuration
>Windows 11 has simplified the process to install WSL by quite a bit. I will include instructions for Windows 11 Easy Mode as well as how to install it on Windows 10 using the manual method.
{: .prompt-info }

### Windows 11 Easy Mode:
1. Most of these commands are going to be run from within Microsoft PowerShell. Click on the Windows Start Launcher and search for PowerShell. Right click on it and select **Open as Administrator** as you will need administrator rights to run these commands. Once open follow the instructions below.
2. Enable Optional Features and install the base WSL system:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

3. This process might take some time depending on your machine specs and internet speed. The installer will download WSL and enable VirtualMachinePlatform for WSL v.2.
4. Reboot your Windows 11 computer.
5. If you get an error about needing the WSL Kernel during the next phase you may need to download the [Windows Linux Kernel](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) and install it before you can continue the install.
6. Open PowerShell as Administrator once again and re-run the WSL installer:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

7. This will begin the installation of Ubuntu as the default distribution. If you wish to install something different you can get a list of available distributions and choose to install a different one.

```powershell
wsl --list --online
wsl --install -d Debian
```

8. Once installation finishes the configuration for Ubuntu will automatically start. You will need to create a new user ID and create a password for the account. These can be the same as your Windows account, but they will remain as separate accounts if you change your password for one or the other OS.

### Windows 10/11 Manual Install Mode:
1. Most of these commands are going to be run from within Microsoft PowerShell. Click on the Windows Start Launcher and search for PowerShell. Right click on it and select **Open as Administrator** as you will need administrator rights to run these commands. Once open follow the instructions below.
2. Enable Optional Feature Microsoft Windows Subsystem Linux:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

3. Check your Windows Build Number to make sure you can install WSL v.2. For Windows 10 you need Version 1903 or later, with Build 18362.1049 or later. If you don't meet the minimum requirement, run Windows Update and install the latest build.

```powershell
winver
```

4. Enable Optional Feature Virtual Machine Platform for WSL v.2:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

5. Restart your computer to enable the new features.
6. Download and install the most recent [Linux Kernel](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) for WSL v.2.
7. Set WSL v.2 as your preferred version of the WSL platform:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

8. Open the Microsoft Store [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv?hl=en-US&gl=US) and select Install.
9. During installation your will see a console window showing the progress. When it finishes with the install it will ask you to setup a new user ID and password. These can be the same as your Windows account, but they will remain as separate accounts if you change your password for one or the other OS.

### Configure Windows Terminal for WSL
1. Now that you have your new WSL Ubuntu (or distro of your choice) we can configure the WIndows Terminal to open a command prompt in our WSL environment by default.
2. Click on Windows Start Launcher and search for **Terminal**. Right-click and **Run as Administrator** to launch it. Most likely on first run it will open a PowerShell console.
3. Using the Drop Down Arrow at the top of the window select **Settings** to open the settings dialog box.

    _Terminal Menu_


4. In the settings Window select **Startup** from the left menu.
5. Now use the dropdown list to select Ubuntu as the Default Profile and Windows Terminal as the Default Terminal.

6. Next time you open the Terminal app, it will default to your new WSL Linux console.

### Do Some Basic Linux Maintenance & Add Some Conveniences
1. Disable password requests for sudo commands. This is optional as it does increase your security risk a bit, but it adds some convenance:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

2. Update this line to read as shown below:

```bash
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

3. If visudo happens to launch the vi editor instead of nano use the first set of commands to save and exit the editor, if it uses nano, use the second set of commands:

```bash
:w
:q
```

```bash
^X (CTRL+X)
Y
<Enter>
```

4. Install Ubuntu updates:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

5. You may want to have access to the Windows Filesystem from inside your WSL environment. Enable it by adding the following lines to the WSL configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
```

```bash
# Enable extra metadata options by default
    [automount]
    enabled = true
    root = /
    options = "metadata,umask=22,fmask=11"
    mountFsTab = false

# Enable DNS - Should be on by default, but we will explicitly enable
    [network]
    generateHosts = true
    generateResolvConf = true
```

6. You may also want to be able to access your Windows User Home folder from your Linux User Home Folder quickly. You can add a symbolic link (shortcut) with the following command:

    >Tip: Linux command line is case sensitive, so any commands you use need to match the case. Also you will need to append any spaces with a \ character as shown below.
    {: prompt-tip}

```bash
ln -s /c/Users/<your \account \here> ~/
```
