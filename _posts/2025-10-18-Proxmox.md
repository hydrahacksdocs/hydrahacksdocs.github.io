{: .prompt-info }

This Hack is going to show you a very basic installation to get you up and running with Proxmox. It is recommended that you consider your networking and security and make adjustments accordingly. It is recommended that you segregate your VM network from your primary and Management networks.

## Hardware Considerations
- For a true virtualization environment, you will want to consider your hardware carefully. It is recommended that you choose a system with multi-core CPU and as much RAM as you can get. Internal storage will be important if you do not yet have a dedicated NAS/SAN for your home lab as well. My Hack will be using the [Minisforum-MS-A2](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-a2?variant=46843404943605).

## Pre-Installation of Proxmox
- You will want to download the ISO image for [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso) and create a bootable USB drive for the install on the hardware. You can follow my Hack on using [YUMI](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Yumi/) to create a multi-boot USB drive to help you if you are not sure how to create one.

## Installation of Proxmox
- Insert your bootable USB drive and launch the installer ISO for Proxmox.
- From the Installation Main Menu select the Install Proxmox VE (Graphical) option.

- Create a complex password and enter your email address. Don't forget to add the new password to [Bitwarden](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Bitwarden/) then select **Next**.

- Once the install is complete you will need to remove the bootable USB and then reboot the system.

## Verify Installation, Update Repositories, and Install Updates

- Once your system finishes rebooting you should be able to log into the WebUI at the IP Address you set and using **root** and the **password** you set during installation.
- Click on the PVE Server name from the left menu, then select the **Updates -> Repositories** option from the expanded menu.
- Select the repository for CEPH then click on **Disable** if you do not plan to use CEPH.
- Select the Enterprise repository and then click on **Disable** if you are not going to pay for Enterprise support.
- Next click on **Add** and select the option for **No-Subscription** then click on **Add** to enable the non-production repository.
- Your repo list should look similar to the image below.

- Now click on the **Updates** menu item from the right menu and click on **Refresh** to update the package cache.
- You should see a few updates that need to be installed. Click on **Upgrade** to install any updates.
- This is an optional step and it is recommended that you review this script before running it. Proxmox as an annoying notice about there being no active subscription for non-production systems. If you would like to remove it you can run this script and follow the prompts. Launch a command line by selecting your PVE server from the left menu then select **Shell** from the right hand menu. Then run the following command.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"

```

- Now reboot your server again from the top menu.
