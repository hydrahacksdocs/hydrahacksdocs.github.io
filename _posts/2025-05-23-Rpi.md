# Synopsis
>So you decided to add a RaspberryPi to your home lab. Let's go through how to get it up and running!
{: .prompt-info }

The RaspberryPi is a low power single board computer (SBC) based on the ARM processor and has a huge community of supporters. There has been more OS options as of recent but we are going to install Ubuntu as that is the same OS we used in our WSL install earlier. You can of course choose your favorite OS, even the official RaspbianOS.

## Getting a RaspberryPi
I have included a couple options for recent versions of the RaspberryPi, including full kits and just the SBC itself if you already have all the accessories needed to get you up and running. Disclaimer: I will make a small percentage from these links at no added cost to you.
- [CanaKit RaspberryPi 5 Pro Kit](https://amzn.to/4dvqljT): If you don't have any accessories to get your RPi up and running, you can start with this kit. It is a great kit from the folks at CanaKit.
- [RaspberryPi 5 SBC](https://amzn.to/4jlfuu6): If you have all the accessories you need and just need the RaspberryPi, this is the official RaspberryPi Store offering.
- [Micro SD Card](https://amzn.to/43yHGUt): I would suggest a 32GB SD, but you can get by with as little as 16GB.
- [USB Card Reader](https://amzn.to/4jl4wF3): You will need a way to write your OS image to the Micro SD card. If you did not buy the CanaKit and don't have a card writer, this is a nice USB/USB-C card reader/writer.

## Installing the OS
1. Download and install the [RaspberryPi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe). This is the recommended way to write your OS image as you can select from various officially supported OS.
2. Install your SD card in your card reader and plug it into your USB port. Ignore any warning about needing to format the drive as RaspberryPi Imager will do all the heavy lifting for us.
3. Start the RaspberryPi Imager application.
4. Click on **Choose Device** to select the hardware version you are using, if you bought either of the RaspberryPi from links above, select **RaspberryPi 5**.

6. Click on **Choose Storage** and select your USB Micro SD Card then click **Next**.
7. You will be given the option to set some defaults for the OS install, I highly recommend that you set the customization. Click on **Edit Settings**.

11. Click on **Save** at the bottom of the dialog box.
12. Click on **Yes** back on the Customization Menu to continue writing the image to your SD card.
13. It will take a few minutes to download the Ubuntu image and then write it to the SD card. Once complete RaspberryPi Imager will notify of a successful write.
14. Remove the USB card reader and then the Micro SD card. Insert the SD card into the RaspberryPi.
15. Connect HDMI, keyboard, network cable and power to boot the RaspberryPi.
16. Once booted, make sure you can log in using the username and password you created during the customization phase earlier.

## Next Steps
1. You are now ready to take on any [RaspberryPi](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/tags/rpi/) projects that you would like.
2. Update & patch the OS.
3. Copy your [SSH Keys](https://hydrahacksdocs.github.io/posts/Ssh/) to the new RaspberryPi.
