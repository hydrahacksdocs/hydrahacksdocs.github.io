# About HydraHacks
HydraHacks was founded on the premise of sharing my experience with my own home lab, technology and many other areas of interest. It gives me an opportunity as well to document my own home lab setup so I can refer to it later. I will try to keep each relevant post up to date as needed. Enjoy your time here and reach out if you have any questions or comments.

## Who is Hydra?
Keenan Johnson, a.k.a "Hydra" is a nickname I picked up long, long ago time ago in....well you get the idea. I am a 30+ year IT Executive who has been there, done that more times than I can count. In my career I have mostly focused in IT Infrastructure, but I dabble in DevOps in my spare time. I have lead IT Infrastructure, Site Reliability Engineering, and Cloud Teams all over the world.

## Hobbies?
Well, you probably have guessed I like to home lab stuff. It gives me a place I can try out new things and keep my skills relevant. I have virtualization, NAS, Security, Networking, Websites, Docker, Home Automation, and CI/CD up and running today.

I also have a deep passion for cars, and I always have some sort of project going on in the shop. I mostly favor Pontiac as my choice for projects, but recently I started on a 1961 Cadillac Fleetwood Series 60 Special for my daughter. I probably have as much grease under my fingernails as worn out keys on a keyboard these days.
